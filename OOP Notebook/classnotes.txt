Classes
    ex:  storing an entire user in the variable
    - Name ,weight, hair color
    - These variables are variables
    - Each object of a class has its own copy of the class's member variables 


Constructors: 
    - A spcial type of method that is invoked ewach time that an object of a class is createad. 
    - Default constructor is waht is given by your computer on its own if values are not specified. 
    - Does not have a return type
    - Constructor has the same name as the Class and MUST BE PUBLIC (might sometimes be private)
    ex: commenting out the attricbutes from the object in the main function and passing them into the constructor of the object

4 Main Pillers or Object Oriented Programming: 
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

Encapsulation:
    - Bundeling data and grouping it together
    - Prevent anyone oranything outside of ourt class to modify or interact with it. (not directly)
    - Provides a way for classes to interact with our data. 
    - Through its methods you access data

Abstraction:
    - Hiding complex things behidn a procedure that makes those things look simple for the users
    - Is used by another class and is implemented inside that class as well.

Inheritance: 
    - A class like a car will have methods like drive,  
    - Derived car like electric cars, gas car, sport car
    - Electric car will have a method called charge, attribute with charge level
    - Gas car will have method called tank (fueling) attribute with tank status
    - 

Polymorphism (many forms)
    - Used when a parent class refrence is used to refer to an object of a child class
